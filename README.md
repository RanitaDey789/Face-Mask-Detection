# Face Mask Detection using MobileNetV2

This project implements **Face Mask Detection** using **MobileNetV2** in TensorFlow/Keras.
The model classifies images into two categories:  
✅ **With Mask**  
❌ **Without Mask**

## Dataset
  The dataset is taken from Kaggle
  _Dataset link:_    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset
  The dataset was not split into train test so we had to do that manually (In the code).
## Requirements
  Python 3.x
  TensorFlow/Keras
  OpenCV
  NumPy
  PIL
  Matplotlib
  Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
  This code is written to upload image and test. Real time webcam can not be implimented cause of the code is written in google colab and it does not support webcam due to security mesuremnts. 
  The same model that is build here can be used in jupyter and real time webcam monitoring can be done.

## This project is free to use :)
